const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = `The second stage of the SDLC where the project team analyzes and documents the requirements of the software system, including the functional and non-functional requirements, technical specifications, and user expectations.`

const design = `The third stage of the SDLC where the software system's architecture and design are developed based on the requirements identified in the previous stage. This includes creating a high-level design, detailed design, and choosing the technology stack.`

const implementation = `The fourth stage of the SDLC where the software system is developed, including coding, testing, debugging, and integration. This stage involves converting the design into a working software system.`

const testingIntegration = `The fifth stage of the SDLC where the software system is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements, is error-free, and integrates well with other systems. This stage includes testing at various levels, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.`

const maintain = `The final stage of the SDLC where the software system is deployed to production, and ongoing maintenance, including bug fixes, enhancements, and updates, are performed. This stage ensures that the software system remains effective and efficient over time.`
